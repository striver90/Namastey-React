  Chapter-05::

  NamedExport = it is used via import with a {} brackets
  Default Export = without {} brackets.There can be only 1 default export in a file.
  * export = If we want to import all exported objects then we will be using * in an import statement.

  Note :: We can have  many functions in a file that can be exported.
  If we want to export all , then use *.
  If there are more than one export, then we need to import via {} brackets.

  config.js usuage??
  -> we will define all constants vaariables inside this files

React Hooks:: Its a function at the end of the day whic is  defined inside a React library.
which function inside react libray??? ===>>> Ans:: useState()
It is used to define the state of a local varibale.

Note:: React does not support two way data binding, like Angular framework does.
So , to achieve two way data binding will make use of hooks i.e useState

  Chapter-07:
  There is a component -RouterProvider which is coming from react-router dom.

  In root.render , we are rendering  AppLayout. Do we always want to render AppLayout?? NO!!!!

  We want to render according to the path.
  So, will do - 
  root.render(<RouterProvider router = {appRouter}/>)


  All the children will go into the Outlet according to the routes
